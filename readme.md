## Synopsis

3T (Train Time Tracker) displays the departure time of your favorite trains at a glance. 

## Code Example

```departure_in_seconds('Hamburg-Langenfelde', 'Altona', 0);```

Explanation: ```departure_in_seconds($from, $to, $connection);```

## Motivation

I never understood why the displays at train and subway platforms display the departure time with "+1" if there is a delay. I wanted to see when the next train or subway departs if I open the webapp. This solved my problem.
